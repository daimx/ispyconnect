# iSpy: Camera Security Software #

I started writing iSpy back in 2007 after finding a superb open source c# .net project called AForge. I spent a while looking around for decent, free motion detection and recording software but didn't have much luck finding any with the capability that AForge provides - so I decided to write it myself.

As iSpy has matured more applications for the technology have become apparent - most obviously security. Existing security and surveillance software is typically expensive, dated and limited with closed source and poor control over sensitivity, lacking in features, virtually no audio support and restrictive limits on data usage. I put all my effort into tackling these problems right from the start. iSpy was written with an enormous feature set that is continually added to whilst using standardised code to connect to the vast majority of web cams and IP cameras available today.

The original aim of creating iSpy to be as sensitive to movement and sound as possible means that it makes an awesome camera security system. There are so many applications for iSpy and people are using it in so many different ways that i'm constantly amazed by the stories I hear - from whale watching, to storm monitoring, meteor showers, protecting top secret documents and yes, even the odd UFO!


**iSpy has a commercial side to it** - the application is free to use as is (including iSpyConnect web access on the same network) but for remote access (outside of your local network) and alerting services (email/ SMS/ twitter/ youtube uploads) you will need to prepay or create a subscription on our website - http://www.ispyconnect.com/  . By doing this you get the best of both worlds - an open source project that is continually developed, improved and supported like a commercial project!

If you are interested in contributing - code enhancements, bug fixes or marketing opportunites i'd love to hear from you!
